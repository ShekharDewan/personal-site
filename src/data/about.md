# Intro

I am a Data Science / ML Engineering guy. I love building software. Co-owner of [Deep Learning Demystified](deeplearningdemystified.com) where I produce write articles and host a podcast on deep learning. My primary job functions are as a data scientist, ML and software engineer.

I am generally a divergent thinker, continually generating new sorts of hypothesis for the sake of exploring the scope of possibility. In other words, I am both creative and methodologically uncommited. I use what works.

In addition, I am a medtitator. 

# Recently

At STATCAN I have learned about large organizations, fulfilling client needs, and extending and maintaining codebases, particularly for a web app.

# My entry into computing

- I grew up with an interest in technology, seeing its many froms and their transformations. In my household, I had seen casettes, floppy disks, the radio, B&W and CRT Televisions, Dial Phones, Mobile Phones, Desktops, the internet, the laptop, Headphones, and the Smartphone.  

- As my interests deepened from form to function, I became more and more deeply curious about how the experiences that technology enabled were created. One of my frequent engagements as a child were video games. 

- This interest lead to programming, and then to questions about the nature of computing, and so intelligence. 

- The theme of Artificial Intelligence began to emerge around this period, and so in my undergraduate, I sought to cover both broad and deep ground in these topics by Doing a double degree : A Joint Honors in Computer Science and Math, as well as a major in Computer Science with a Philosophy Minor. 

- I began to then try to percieve the mind from both within and without : all experiences were engaged in by the mind, yet the source lay in matter. Computing was an artificial recreation of this : a product of the mind, yet not fully understood by it, especially with all the confluences of invention. 

- Thus, it became apparent to me that although the mind was both the beginning and end, what lay in the middle depended on the nature of the phenomena itself. The phenomena was sometimes internal to the mind (a thought) or external (a change in the world which caused thought). 

- Computing was a thought that created other thoughts, yet we could not predict those other thougts (the result of computing) without using different supporting thoughts (investigative tools, such as testing). For example, a computer program, thought mentally concieved, was not fully predictable by the mind. With testing and interaction, other information supplied our understanding, leading to a better sense of the outcome. 

- Artificial intelligence too was similar in two ways. Firstly, it is simple in theory yet not easy to predict. Secondly, creating something like a general intelligence will require that it have the ability to continually reformulate thought as humans do (different ideas about how things work and what should be donme). 

- Thus, as I engage in the practicalities of computing, I continue to reflect more generally on the nature and scope of this field - in some ways similar to others, yet in another way a direct parallel of us as humans, realized in quite a different medium. 

- I consider myself thus very fortunate to be part of this. 

# What I'm like

My primary motivation is towards becoming a fuller person: someone who is both stronger in character and more forgiving. Thus in every moment, my object is to dispact all responsibilities are various levels of abstraction well.  

In other words, I see life as one continuous field, and find it meaningful to improve my relation to all parts of that field. 

I promise I don't talk like this in person. 

# Travel / Geography

- I grew up in India, a land very dear to my heart.
